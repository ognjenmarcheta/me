## &#x270d; About Me

üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Software Engineer at Helu <br>
üïπÔ∏è Former Game Developer <br>
üì∑ üé• Photography/Filmmaking Hobbyist. <br>
üïäÔ∏è Stoic

Proactive software engineer with over 10 years in software engineering. My stoic mindset shapes my approach to software engineering, fostering resilience in the face of challenges and maintaining a calm, focused demeanor even in high-pressure situations.

I've always been driven by technology and innovation. Started my adventure with the soldering iron and disassembled toys as a kid with a high interest in electricity and magnetism. Sega Mega Drive and PS1 console distracted me until Dial-up and Internet got my attention, then I discovered modding, programming, and whatnot. It never stopped since then. I'm learning new things on daily basis and I think I'm addicted to it. If there is only one thing I've realized during this time then it is that the following quote is true:

"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know"

Let's connect! Whether it's to discuss tech trends, explore collaboration opportunities, or share our experiences, I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals.
